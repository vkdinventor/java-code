Must do Tree problem.

* Check if two given binary trees are identical or not | Iterative & Recursive 
* Calculate height of a binary tree | Iterative & Recursive
* Delete given Binary Tree | Iterative & Recursive
* Inorder Tree Traversal | Iterative & Recursive  -> use stack
* Preorder Tree Traversal | Iterative & Recursive  -> use stack
* Postorder Tree Traversal | Iterative & Recursive -> use two stack
* Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree -> queue
* Spiral Order Traversal of Binary Tree -> ques and stack or only stack

* Reverse Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree 
    similar to iterative level order put result in stack and pop it at the end of iteration.
    put right first then left
    
* Print all nodes of a given binary tree in specific order

* Print Left View of a Binary Tree
* Print Right View of a Binary Tree
    both similar to iterative level order
    
* Print Bottom View of Binary Tree
* Print Top View of Binary Tree

* Convert binary tree to its mirror
* Check if binary tree can be converted to another by doing any no. of swaps of left & right child
* Find Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree
* Print all paths from root to leaf nodes in given binary tree
* Find ancestors of given treeNode in a Binary Tree
* Find the distance between given pairs of nodes in a binary tree
* Find Vertical Sum in a given Binary Tree

* Convert given binary tree to full tree by removing half nodes
* Truncate given binary tree to remove nodes which lie on a path having sum less than K
* Find maximum sum root-to-leaf path in a binary tree
* Check if given binary tree is height balanced or not

* Find maximum width of given binary tree
* Build Binary Tree from given Parent array
* Find all nodes at given distance from leaf nodes in a binary tree
* Count all subtrees having same value of nodes in a binary tree
* Find Maximum Difference Between a linklist.Node and its Descendants in a Binary Tree
* Construct a Binary Tree from Ancestor Matrix
* Calculate height of a binary tree with leaf nodes forming a circular doubly linked list
